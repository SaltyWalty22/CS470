•	Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.
The course helped understand more about cloud-based services like AWS and how easily they work. Each component has a nice UI that works well together, and you only need to pay for the services that the individual sets up. I am more well-versed IT individual now and this course helped me reach one of my professional goals. I plan on putting myself in job positions that will force me to learning and get coding repetition to take myself to the next level.
