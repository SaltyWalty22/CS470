•	Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.

The course helped understand more about cloud-based services like AWS and how easily they work. Each component has a nice UI that works well together, and you only need to pay for the services that the individual sets up. I am more well-versed IT individual now and this course helped me reach one of my professional goals. I plan on putting myself in job positions that will force me to learning and get coding repetition to take myself to the next level. 

•	Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:

I would have teams investigate how the functions and services interact when it comes to error handling. The microservices are easily able to scale as needed but the hard part is estimated the cost. It would be worth estimating the cost with a high margin of error so that you aren’t surprised.  Even though serverless is more cost-effective, containers are more cost predictable.
